### 1. Who collected the data?

"Murray Cox conceived the project, compiled and analyzed the data and built the site[1]."

---

### 2. Why did they collect it?

1."The project was created out of a need for cities and residents to understand the true impact of Airbnb on their communities[2]."  

2."The data provide a useful basis for examining and monitoring Airbnb practices and penetration across local and regional housing markets[3]."

3.Make Airbnb is more transparent.

4.Prevent Airbnb once again appears to have manipulated data to conceal illegal activity and to help tenants rights groups and housing advocates understand Airbnb’s impact on their cities and arm them with the data they need to make their case[4].

---

### 3. How was it collected?

1.Source: The data is sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site[1]."

2.Method: "Murray wrote code to scrape Airbnb’s online data and mapped the results, using open-source software tools to create an interactive web-based interface[5]."

---

### 4. What useful information does it contain?

1.House location: We can know the distribution of house location.

2.Price：We can know the distribution of house prices.

3.Housing type, number of days scheduled, capacity：Check for violations of local regulations.

4.Traffic: Assess the impact of traffic on the distribution of houses.

5.Host Information：Personal or Business operator.

6.Review: Analyzing the review keywords can know which factors people prefer when choosing a house.

---

### 5. What useful information is it missing?

1.Some columns contain invalid data(randomly missing) but it is fine.

2.The changes of prices/The fluctuation range of price (including dates). If they exist, we can explore which factors have a greater impact on house prices.

3.Photo number. If it exists, we can more accurately describe the user portraits of super hosts.

4.Number of collections of house. If it exists, we can explore which factors have a greater impact on the preference of a house.

### 6. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

I think the completeness of this data should be evaluated “based on issue coverage -- that is, the presence or absence of the data needed for a given research question[6]." Murray Cox used it to expose Airbnb's illegal activities for making cities and residents understand the true impact of Airbnb on their communities. This data can also support our simple understanding of Airbnb operations in some cities. From this perspective, maybe this data ‘complete’. However, if we expect it can be used to answer more complicated questions, this data is incomplete(structurally missing), because we need to add more data or combine other data to answer these more complex questions. What is more, While the data is widely used in academic research, "no independent researchers have provided an evaluation of the data and its validity[7]," which may mislead us to the wrong result.来源7 Overall, This data can help us answer many simple questions about Airbnb and our cities, but it also has limitations.

### 7. What kinds of analysis would this support?

In addition to supporting some simple analysis, Such as the distribution of house location, Personal host or Business operator, the relevant variables to price and Airbnb listing popularity analysis, this data can be used to understand the relationship between Airbnb and surrounding communities because the original purpose of cox collecting it is to "combat" Airbnb and protect low-income groups. For example, "Airbnb has enabled tourism accommodations to penetrate residential neighborhoods, which creates conflicts between visitors and residents[3]." What is more, We can evaluate does Airbnb increase the price level of local housing rentals? (compare that to long-term rentals) and check for violations of local regulations.

---

### 8. What kinds of analysis would it _not_ support?

1.Firstly, the data can not support correlation analysis of price in the time dimension. For example, "historical data for the houses prices and availability are not available, so we are unable to check for the variability of price and availability on different seasons/time[8]."

2.Secondly, the data can not support the analsis of some deep community questions. For instance, "Airbnb effects on the permanent housing supply, and whether hosts gain sufficient income to offset their own affordability problems[3]."

3.Thirdly, the data can not support the analsis of "whether Airbnb rentals generate significant neighborhood impacts like noise, congestion, and competition for parking[3]."

### 9. Which of the uses presented in Q.7 and Q.8 are _ethical_?

My opinion is all uses listed in Q.7 and Q.8 are ethical. What I want to emphasize is that technology/data is not guilty, and the basis for judging whether data usage violates ethics is the purpose of use. To start with, as for privacy, the data is sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site and it has been analyzed, cleansed and aggregated. In other words, no "private" information(host’s privacy and Location information for listings) is being exposed. So It’s ethical when we do some simple analysis. What is more, the data helps maintain justice. Murray Cox found the company had removed over 1000 listings that violated New York's multiple dwelling law just before the data was released in 2016. This action is ethical. Besides, by analyzing this data, we can evaluate the impact of Airbnb on communities. These are objective and valuable for society and that’s why many cities and research institutes fund this project. Overall, all uses listed in Q.7 and Q.8 are ethical.

However, it is possible that data that was ethically collected could be used for unethical purposes. Airbnb’s competitors may use this data to discredit it. They only emphasize the negative impact of Airbnb on the community and the city. This purpose is not objective and unethical. I think ethical purposes should be objective and comprehensive. The data can not only show some negative impacts but some positive impacts such as providing more income opportunities. So I suggest that Murray Cox needs to do better.

But we need to note that this is not a completely “correct” data because it lacks researchers' evaluation of the validity of its data, and Alsudais pointed out that there is a data quality issue in this dataset[7]. Let’s make a hypothesis. If this data is subjectively altered to destroy its accuracy and objectivity, such behavior is unethical. This data cannot be used by the public, no matter how ethical the user’s purpose is.
